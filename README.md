# Parallel-Word-Search-Using-OpenMP
This project is based on executing parallel word search from words stored in file system and database and time taken to find the count of words from both storage systems

Word search searches for words in multiple text files in parallel using open MP concepts. This
reduces the execution time of the code as compared to the sequential word search. The documents
are scanned word by word and a dictionary is maintained so that words can be searched. Since
documents can have several thousands of terms scanning each term can take a lot of time and hence
there is a lot of scope for parallelization. The purpose of this project to analysis which word search
method is efficient to handle the multiple files as well as handling multiple tables of the database.
The conclusion of this project will give us an idea about whether parallel execution is able to
enhance the performance of the word search as compared to serial execution. This could be helpful
for future word searching engines, word puzzles and lot more real life applications.
